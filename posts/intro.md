## Hey, Iâ€™m Archie ðŸ‘‹

This is my application for the web engineer role at Daybridge. Itâ€™s a timeline of what Iâ€™ve been up to for the last 5 years including work, projects and education. Iâ€™ve used screenshots of Daybridge as design inspiration for the site.

### Why this job

For the last 6 months, Iâ€™ve been working myself as a freelancer and running a two-man agency with a friend. Iâ€™ve found myself doing a mixture of sales, design and development and have been through lots of highs and lows. Whilst contracting has provided me with valuable experiences, Iâ€™m a product person. I like to play a bigger role in the decision-making process, see my work out in the wild and get feedback from users.

I think of myself as a generalist but my true passion lies in web development. I love crafting beautiful user experiences, working with all the different parts of the application and being able to see the impact I have on the product.

Working as a web engineer at Daybridge seems like the perfect role to experience the above.

### Why Daybridge

I want to work at Daybridge for two reasons. The transparency of the company and the attention to detail in the product.

Watching the product develop from the sidelines has been inspiring. I often see Daybridge employees share their work and it's obvious how passionate the team is about the product. I want to work for a company that encourages this and is comfortable with its employees working on their own projects.

In terms of the product, I am a big fan of the direction that Daybridge is going in and firmly believe in the need for it. I think the job would be highly-rewarding as I would be working on some exciting, novel features for the calendar and adding to the already beautiful design.

### Why Me

Hereâ€™s a few quick reasons why I think Iâ€™m a good fit for Daybridge ðŸ‘‡

- **Self-starter**
- **High attention to detail**
- **I understand the big picture**
- **Passionate about the product**
